I have initialized this repository using git init

You can tell whether a repository has been initialized in any
directory by typing ls -a and searching for a .git file

Once I initialize a repository I can check the commit history using
git log. If I do this I'll get the output

			fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD'

HEAD is git's word for the current commit so git is basically telling
me that I have no commits. I can check this by typing git status which
returns the files that have changed since the last commit. Right now
its prints out 
	
			On branch master

			Initial commit

So clearly the only commit has been the initalization of the git.
Git status is also outputing the message 

		Changes to be committed:
		  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

			new file:   file1.txt

The message is saying that I have added a file, 'file1.txt' to the staging area to be committed. This message is followed by another message.

		Changes not staged for commit:
		  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
		  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

			modified:   file1.txt

This message is stating that I have modified the file, 'file1.txt' since 
adding it to the staging area. It is warning me that if I checkout 
another branch my changes will be lost. If I add it to the next commit 
then my changes will be saved. 

As a test I'm going to see what happens if I commit the new file and 
type git status. Then I'll see what happens if I make changes to it.
If all goes as expected, the git status will initially output the 
message. "Changes to be committed" followed by the file name, and
will not output the message "Changes not staged for commit"

So it all went expected so far. Here is the output of git status after
adding the changes in file1.txt to the staging area. 

				On branch master

				Initial commit

				Changes to be committed:
				  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

					new file:   file1.txt

Now if I type in git status I should get the errors.
